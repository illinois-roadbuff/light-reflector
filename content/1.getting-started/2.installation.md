<Steps>

### Installing via Codeberg Releases

Head over to releases and download the `.rbxm` file from the latest version on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/project-roadwork/light-reflector/releases). 
**It's recommended to place the module under `ReplicatedStorage`, however you may place it wherever you'd like.** 

<warning>
  A package is available in Wally and Pesde; however, they are broken at the moment and should not be used in production.
</warning>

### Inserting into Roblox Studio

Right click `ReplicatedStorage` in the explorer, then press `Insert Roblox model` and insert `.rbxm` file you downloaded from Codeberg into Roblox Studio.
